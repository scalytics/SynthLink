# SynthLink60 Catalog: Historical Impact Analysis

This file is part of the SynthLink60 Catalog, containing 10 complex, multi-hop questions designed for deep search testing. These questions focus on how past events, inventions, or figures influenced societal, economic, or cultural changes. Each question requires iterative linking of information, synthesis of insights, fact-checking against traceable sources, and uncovering novel connections without hallucinations. The questions mimic the style of the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset but are tailored for research-like tasks.
