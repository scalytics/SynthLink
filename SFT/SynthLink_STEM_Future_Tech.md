# SynthLink60 Catalog: STEM and Future Tech

This file is part of the SynthLink60 Catalog, containing 10 complex, multi-hop questions designed for deep search testing. These questions explore the development, implications, and challenges of cutting-edge STEM fields and future technologies, such as quantum computing, artificial general intelligence (AGI), artificial superintelligence (ASI), and related areas. Each question requires iterative linking of information, synthesis of insights, fact-checking against traceable sources, and uncovering novel connections without hallucinations. The questions mimic the style of the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset but are tailored for research-like tasks.
