# SynthLink60 Catalog: Environmental and Ecological Consequences

This file is part of the SynthLink60 Catalog, containing 10 complex, multi-hop questions designed for deep search testing. These questions investigate the environmental impact of events, policies, or human activities. Each question requires iterative linking of information, synthesis of insights, fact-checking against traceable sources, and uncovering novel connections without hallucinations. The questions mimic the style of the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset but are tailored for research-like tasks.

| Question ID | Question Text | Expected Answer Summary | Traceable Sources | Reasoning Steps |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| EEC-01 | How did the Deepwater Horizon oil spill affect Gulf of Mexico ecosystems? | The 2010 spill released millions of barrels of oil, harming marine life, fisheries, and coastal habitats, with lasting ecological damage. | Topics: Deepwater Horizon oil spill | 1.
