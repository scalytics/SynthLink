# SynthLink60 Catalog: Scientific and Technological Evolution

This file is part of the SynthLink60 Catalog, containing 10 complex, multi-hop questions designed for deep search testing. These questions trace the development and consequences of scientific discoveries or technologies. Each question requires iterative linking of information, synthesis of insights, fact-checking against traceable sources, and uncovering novel connections without hallucinations. The questions mimic the style of the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset but are tailored for research-like tasks.
